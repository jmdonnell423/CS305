Software Security
This is a repository of my work form CS305 Software Security. 
Included is my final project. 

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). They are seeking Global Rain’s expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I did a lot of work in improving my identification of vulnerabilities especially in ststic testing. While this began as a weakness for me I turned this into a strength by the end of the course. Analyzing the vulnerabilites to ensure that there actually was a vulnerability present based off of the CVE information was also a strong point. Securely coding is important to the well being and protection of users and companies in general. Ensuring that data is transmitted and stored securely protects the users who interact with the system by protecting their personal information, ensuring that tasks and data sent were sent from that user, and ensuring that data recieved has not been altered or compromised in any way. Protecting the users in turn protects the company from liability and protects their information from falling into the hands of competitors. Software security brings peace of mind to those who are responsible for security and protection from liability. When done correctly security doesn't need to affect users greatly and instills the peace of mind to their users that their information is safe. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Vulnerability assesment was a challenge for me mostly due to a lack of coding experience. Understanding what the different pieces of code were doing was a weakness that hiondered my ability to understand whether a vulnerability was a false positive or an actual problem. It took me some time to catch up, but overall this weakness has been transformed into a strength.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Understanding the system is integral to knowing how to mitigate vulnerabilities. While simple fixes such as using updated libraries and coding in a way that secures input from injection errors are easy to implement every time there are certain facets to each system that are different. Understanding where data is accessed and transmitted helps the programmer understand where security needs to be implemented. Starting from broad categories and systematically breaking down into smaller categories helps capture every vulnerability you can.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I made sure to implement SSL security layers in order to ensure data integrity as well as the ability to transmit encrypted data. I verfied that I took a vulnerability assesment from before I started the project and then compared it to the end resulting assesment to ensure there were no new vulnerabilities added. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Being able to show future employers that I can turn a weakness into a strength and show that I am able to change my mindset in order to catch up even when I myself thought I wasn't going to be able to this course taught me I can handle more than I thought.
